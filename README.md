# AutoGS
## Automated Indoor Greenhouse Final Project for ICS4U

AutoGS is short for Automated Greenhouse System. It was created for the final project for our computer science course. <br>
The purpose of AutoGS is to be able grow and maintain plants, just like a greenhouse except it is compact and kept inside. <br>
AutoGS has features like watering, which can be done either automatically or manually. It also features LED lighting and <br>
sensors that include temperature, humidity, and moisture sensor. The automatic watering is done through the mositure <br>
sensor, and manual watering is done through by typing a set number of seconds. The biggest aspect of AutoGS is that <br>
it is all controlled on a website. There is no way to control the greenhouse physically! <br>
